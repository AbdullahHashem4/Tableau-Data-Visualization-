# Tableau Data Visualization Projects ðŸ’¹ 
## Global Tech Experience Internship - Tableau Analysis

**1. UNESCO Dataset:âœ…** 
In this project for Tableau, I analyzed a dataset containing UNESCO's world heritage sites, categorizing them as cultural, natural, or mixed. Utilizing Tableau, I visualized the data findings across multiple sheets. 
- Sheet 1, I created a bar chart illustrating the distribution of heritage sites by type. 
- Sheet 2 presented a stacked bar chart showcasing the number of sites on the danger list for each category, distinguishing between endangered and non-endangered sites. 
- Sheet 3 featured a side-by-side bar chart further breaking down endangered and non-endangered sites by category. 
- In Sheet 4, I identified countries with the largest numbers of heritage sites through a sorted bar chart. 
- In Sheet 5, I depicted the countries with the largest physical areas dedicated to heritage sites. For a more detailed analysis, an optional LevelUp task focused on France's heritage sites, where I created a bar graph showing the total area in hectares for each site, with tooltips providing additional information on category. Finally, I addressed scaling issues by adjusting the Area Hectares axis to logarithmic in order to better represent the distribution of smaller sites alongside larger ones.

**2. Forbes Dataset:âœ…**
In this project focused on creating foundational charts using Tableau, I utilized a Forbes dataset detailing the earnings of top celebrities from 2005 to 2020, particularly examining the gender pay gap among actors and actresses. 
- In Sheet 1, "Yearly Actor Earnings By Sex," I recreated a side-by-side bar chart displaying the total earnings by gender for each year from 2016 to 2020, filtering by gender (male and female) and category (actors and actresses), while also creating a tooltip to display the number of actors or actresses for each bar. 
- In Sheet 2, "Actor Earnings By Sex," I compared the average compensation of actors and actresses through a bar chart with corresponding filters. 
- In Sheet 3, "Highest Paid Actors," I created a horizontal bar chart showcasing the top 10 highest-paid actors and actresses, colored by gender, and answered questions regarding the gender distribution within this list.
- In Sheet 4, "Celeb Earnings Over Time," I visualized the trend of average earnings for actors and actresses over the years using a line chart, analyzing whether the pay gap widened or narrowed. 
-For the LevelUp task, I constructed a stacked bar chart of total earnings per celebrity category, identifying whether certain categories were dominated by one gender.

**3. Multifaceted Dataset:âœ…**
In this project focused on basic visualizations using Tableau, I worked with three diverse datasets: one detailing adult male and female heights by country, another tracking music sales from 1973 to 2019, and a third focusing on global video game sales.
- Sheet 1 visualized countries with male average heights exceeding the world average.
- Sheet 2 replicated this analysis for female heights, identifying a unique gender disparity in South American countries.
- In Sheet 3, I charted the total music sales over the years, pinpointing the peak sales volume.
- Sheet 4 showcased a stacked bar chart depicting total music sales by year and format, highlighting dominant formats in specific years.
- Sheet 5 featured a sorted bar chart revealing the three video game genres with the highest total global sales. 
-Additionally, LevelUp tasks on Sheets 1 and 2 explored alternative visualization techniques for height data, offering insights into countries with taller or shorter women compared to the global average.

**4. UFO Sightings Dataset:âœ…**
In this project I focused on calculated fields within Tableau, I worked with two datasets: one detailing UFO sightings by state and another by country, aiming to discern patterns in UFO encounters, including timing, duration, and shapes.
- In the UFOSightingsByState sheet 1, I extracted state codes from the Location column and capitalized them to create a custom calculated field, subsequently visualizing the number of UFO sightings by state in a descending bar chart, with the top three states being answered in the Questions sheet.
- Moving to the NumberSightingsPerCountry sheet 2, I extracted country codes and capitalized them, then presented a text table displaying the total sightings per country, with the number of sightings in the United States answered in the Questions sheet.
- On the UFOSightingsLengthByMonth sheet 3, I calculated the length of UFO encounters in minutes, creating a bar chart of average encounter lengths per month, with the months of longest sightings answered in the Questions sheet.
- Shifting to the UFOSightingsByShape sheet 4, I capitalized UFO shape descriptions and visualized the most commonly encountered shapes in a descending bar chart, with the most common shape answered in the Questions sheet.
- Finally, in the UFOSightingsByHour sheet 5, I visualized the number of UFO sightings by each hour of the day, with the most popular sighting time answered in the Questions sheet. 
- For the LevelUp task, I converted descriptions to lowercase, identified prevalent UFO colors through conditional statements, and created a bar chart showcasing the most common UFO colors, with the dominant color answered in the Questions sheet.
