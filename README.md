##Global Tech Experience Internship - Tableau Analysis

**UNESCO Dataset**: 
In this project for Tableau, I analyzed a dataset containing UNESCO's world heritage sites, categorizing them as cultural, natural, or mixed. Utilizing Tableau, I visualized the data findings across multiple sheets. 
-Sheet 1, I created a bar chart illustrating the distribution of heritage sites by type. 
-Sheet 2 presented a stacked bar chart showcasing the number of sites on the danger list for each category, distinguishing between endangered and non-endangered sites. 
-Sheet 3 featured a side-by-side bar chart further breaking down endangered and non-endangered sites by category. 
-In Sheet 4, I identified countries with the largest numbers of heritage sites through a sorted bar chart. 
-In Sheet 5, I depicted the countries with the largest physical areas dedicated to heritage sites. For a more detailed analysis, an optional LevelUp task focused on France's heritage sites, where I created a bar graph showing the total area in hectares for each site, with tooltips providing additional information on category. Finally, I addressed scaling issues by adjusting the Area Hectares axis to logarithmic in order to better represent the distribution of smaller sites alongside larger ones.

**Forbes Dataset**
In this project  focused on creating foundational charts using Tableau, I utilized a Forbes dataset detailing the earnings of top celebrities from 2005 to 2020, particularly examining the gender pay gap among actors and actresses. 
-In Sheet 1, "Yearly Actor Earnings By Sex," I recreated a side-by-side bar chart displaying the total earnings by gender for each year from 2016 to 2020, filtering by gender (male and female) and category (actors and actresses), while also creating a tooltip to display the number of actors or actresses for each bar. 
-In Sheet 2, "Actor Earnings By Sex," I compared the average compensation of actors and actresses through a bar chart with corresponding filters. 
- In Sheet 3, "Highest Paid Actors," I created a horizontal bar chart showcasing the top 10 highest-paid actors and actresses, colored by gender, and answered questions regarding the gender distribution within this list.
-In Sheet 4, "Celeb Earnings Over Time," I visualized the trend of average earnings for actors and actresses over the years using a line chart, analyzing whether the pay gap widened or narrowed. For the LevelUp task, I constructed a stacked bar chart of total earnings per celebrity category, identifying whether certain categories were dominated by one gender.
