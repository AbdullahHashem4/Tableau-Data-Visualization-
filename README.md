##Global Tech Experience Internship - Tableau Analysis

**UNESCO Dataset**: 
In this project milestone for Tableau, I analyzed a dataset containing UNESCO's world heritage sites, categorizing them as cultural, natural, or mixed. Utilizing Tableau, I visualized the data findings across multiple sheets. In Sheet 1, I created a bar chart illustrating the distribution of heritage sites by type. Sheet 2 presented a stacked bar chart showcasing the number of sites on the danger list for each category, distinguishing between endangered and non-endangered sites. Sheet 3 featured a side-by-side bar chart further breaking down endangered and non-endangered sites by category. In Sheet 4, I identified countries with the largest numbers of heritage sites through a sorted bar chart. Additionally, in Sheet 5, I depicted the countries with the largest physical areas dedicated to heritage sites. For a more detailed analysis, an optional LevelUp task focused on France's heritage sites, where I created a bar graph showing the total area in hectares for each site, with tooltips providing additional information on category. Finally, I addressed scaling issues by adjusting the Area Hectares axis to logarithmic in order to better represent the distribution of smaller sites alongside larger ones.
